# How to Help With XKPASSWD

Yes, and we welcome help. xkpasswd-js is an open source project being managed through GitHub. You can find the repository at [xkpasswd-js](https://github.com/bartificer/xkpasswd-js).

Start by reading the [README.md](https://github.com/bartificer/xkpasswd-js/blob/main/README.md) where you'll learn about the [repository structure](https://github.com/bartificer/xkpasswd-js/blob/main/README.md#repository-structure) and prerequisites[](https://github.com/bartificer/xkpasswd-js/blob/main/README.md#repository-structure). We also have a versioning policy, a source control policy, and a style guide.

If all of this sounds intimidating and you just want to document something that doesn't work properly, or maybe tell us about a feature you'd like, you can [go directly to the Issues tab](https://github.com/bartificer/xkpasswd-js/issues) and submit a new issue. 

We also have a [discussion area in GitHub](https://github.com/bartificer/xkpasswd-js/discussions) where you can chat with contributors about the project, maybe ask questions and share user stories about how awesome XKPASSWD is üòÅ.

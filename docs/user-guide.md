### Why is it beta?

When you first go to [xkpasswd.net](https://xkpasswd.net) while the project is in beta, you'll see an explanation of how this tool is being ported from old and busted Perl code to modern web-development languages including JavaScript. You'll be invited to push the "Use the Beta" button to get started. You can get directly to the beta version by going to [beta.xkpasswd.net](https://beta.xkpasswd.net).

The tool is not yet feature-complete, but what you are able to use is functioning properly. If any feature is not functioning properly when you visit the tool, you'll see it labeled as such.

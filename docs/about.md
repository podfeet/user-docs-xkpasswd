# About

[xkpasswd-js](https://github.com/bartificer/xkpasswd-js) is an open source project that is the brainchild of developer and Security Specialist [Bart Busschots](https://github.com/bartificer). This JavaScript version of XKPASSWD is a port of Bart's original perl code. 

This new version is being developed by primarily by Helma van der Linden along with other open source contributors. If you'd like to get involved in the development, including adding to the wishlist for features, read more [here](help-xkpasswd.md).

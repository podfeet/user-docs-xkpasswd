# XKPASSWD User Documentation

### What is XKPASSWD?

XKPASSWD is a web app designed to help you create long, strong, and yet memorable _and_ typable psswords.

### What's the Problem to be Solved?

We all know we should be using long, strong passwords, but we tend to fall back on bad habits because they're hard to remember and hard to type, especially on mobile devices, or even worse â€“ on a printer.

XKPASSWD can help you create passwords for very specific situations, such as creating an Apple ID password that you can type on an iPhone without constant switching back and forth with different keyboard layouts.

### Is XKPASSWD a Password Manager?

XKPASSWD is _not_ a password manager. It doesn't store any passwords you create, but rather allows you to copy them and add them to your dedicated password manager. You _are_ using a password manager, right?
